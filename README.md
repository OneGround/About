Fundament is the implementation by Roxit of "case oriented" Api's and registrations according to the [VNG specifications](<https://vng-realisatie.github.io/gemma-zaken/standaard/>).
It contains ZTC, ZRC, DRC, BRC, NC, AC and reference lists.

Fundament comes in two ways: attended and unattended. Attended is the full Saas variant currently available. Unattended is the Open Source variant which will be released later. 

## Usage of Fundament (attended)
In order to use the attended (Saas) version of Fundament, contact Roxit and request a log in tot the configuration tool.

The only prerequisite for using Fundament is an RSIN, the KvK (chamber of commerce) identificantion of your organisation. 

## Characteristics of Fundament (attended)
