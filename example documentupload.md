Attached is an example [Postman project](./examplepm.json) with a sequence for document upload in parts (bestandsdelen).

Please pay attention to the following:

- the JWT should be generated using a Client ID and secret
- the field bronorganisatie in the body of step 1 should contain the rsin of the organisation that owns the DRC (thus, the rsin of the customer) 
- the field "inhoud" in the body of step 1 should be null
- the field "bestandsomvang" in the body of step 1 should match the number if bytes in your sample file in step 2
- the response to step 1  contains a lock, and the url to the bestandsdelen
